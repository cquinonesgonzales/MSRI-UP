aggregate enrollment by district 
Merge with enrollment from dropout 
Compare numbers 
Have variables for gender and ethnicity 

```{r}
library(stringr)
# We are going to compare it to the enrollment data that came from the Dropout data set, so first we will load a table with that information 

enrollment 

# Now, we will try to create a similar table with the data from the enrollment data sets. Some reminders on how to:
# download enrollment data (x)
# convert to csv's (x)
# remove scientific notation (x)
# load into R (x)
# add "years" columns: 20xx-yy (x)
# stack the years (x)
# get rid of uneccesary columns (including any grades below 7th) (x)
# aggregate to have gender columns 
# aggregate to have ethnicity columns 
# extract the district numbers into new column 
# create a dist_year column

Re doing all of our merged data lol 

```{r}
do_demo <- read.csv(file="do_demo.csv", header=T)
cp_demo <- read.csv(file="cp_demo.csv", header=T)
ucCsu_demo 

en_do_demo <- merge(Enroll_demo, do_demo, by="dist_year")
en_do_cp_demo <- merge(en_do_demo, cp_demo, by="dist_year")
en_do_cp_ucCsu_demo <- merge(en_do_cp_demo, ucCsu_demo, by="dist_year")
write.csv(en_do_cp_ucCsu_demo, file="/Users/owner/en_do_cp_ucCsu_demographix.csv")
```

Now, to do the large, complete merge 
```{r}
exp_demo
sus_demo
sus_demo <- read.csv(file = "suspensiondemo.csv", header = T)

merge1 <- merge(en_do_cp_ucCsu_demo, exp_demo, by="dist_year")
completeMerge <- merge(merge1, sus_demo, by="dist_year")
completeMerge <- completeMerge[,-c(9,17,35)] # removing col with indices 

# Now we are going to add a total column for ucCsu, do, exp, sus, and en 
completeMerge$ucCsu_total <- completeMerge$ucCsu_female + completeMerge$ucCsu_male
completeMerge$do_total <- completeMerge$do_female + completeMerge$do_male
completeMerge$exp_tot <- completeMerge$Expulsions_Females + completeMerge$Expulsions_Males
completeMerge$sus_tot <- completeMerge$Female.Suspensions + completeMerge$Male.Suspensions
completeMerge$enroll_tot <- completeMerge$enroll_female + completeMerge$enroll_male

write.csv(completeMerge, file="/Users/owner/completeMerge.csv")

```
