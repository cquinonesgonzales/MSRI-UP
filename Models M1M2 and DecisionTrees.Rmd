So, I have been using "as.integer" becuase I did not know not to, and now I have to redo my models. This is the code to do so. 
The things we will do here:
1. Model (One) Graduates with Dropouts, Suspensions, Expulsions, English Learner, Free/Reduced Lunch, and Foster
2. Model (Two) Graduates with every variables except graduate demographics 
3. Check collinearity for Model 1
4. Check collinearity for Model 2 (o)
5. Model One with standardized and normalized data 
6. Model Two with standardized and normalized data 
7. Model One broken down by gender with standardized and normalized data 
8. Model One broken down by ethnicity with standardized and normalized data 
9. For each one of the models, use stargazed to export a latex table with the coefficient, p-value, and standard error

Now, we will do Decision trees. 
We will do this with relative data that does not contain enrollment information (model two) 
```{r}

library(randomForest)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

#tree1 <- tree(ucCsu_totalrel~., data = modeltwoDFREL)
#plot(tree1)
#text(tree1, cex = .3)
#summary(tree1)

rpart1 <- rpart(ucCsu_totalrel~., data = modeltwoDFREL, method = "anova")
printcp(rpart1)
plotcp(rpart1)

plot(rpart1, uniform = T, main = "Regression Tree")
text(rpart1, use.n = T, all = T, cex = 0.8)

pruned <- prune(rpart1, cp=0.04)
plot(pruned)
text(pruned, cex = .75, use.n = F, all = T, label=c('test'))
prp(pruned, faclen = 5)


plot(modeltwoDFREL$MaleSuspensionsrel, modeltwoDFREL$ucCsu_totalrel) # plot next to the tree - there is no linearity but the deicsion tree tels you there is a realtionship between male suspension and graduates that linear models do not tell you but you could explore further 

plot <- ggplot(modeltwoDFREL, aes(MaleSuspensionsrel, ucCsu_totalrel)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Male Suspensions vs. UC/CSU Eligible Graduates", subtitle = "Using Enrollment Normalized Data", x = "Male Suspensions", y = "UC/CSU Eligible Graduates") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 

plot(plot)

```
