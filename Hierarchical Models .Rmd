In this R Markdown, we will run Hierarchical modeling. We will begin by looking at individual years. 
Begin by making a data frame with 3 variables: the number of dropouts, the ethnicity/gender (so we will have 2 data frames), and school 

```{r}
library(lme4) # package to run models 
library(lmerTest) # package to give p values for analyses which lme4 does not automatically do 
library(dplyr) # to use the filter function 
library(reshape2) # to use "cast" function 
library(reshape)
library(stargazer) # to export data

dropoutsin2011$DropoutTotal <- dropoutsin2011$DTOT + dropoutsin2011$D7 + dropoutsin2011$D8 # adding a column of dropout totals 

HMLGENDF <- dropoutsin2011[,c(2, 4, 22)] # creating new data frame with "CDS_CODE" which we will use to identify the school, gender, and DropoutTotal 
HMLETHDF <- dropoutsin2011[,c(2,3, 22)] # same but with ethnicity instead of gender
